## Creating a Custom Recipe

The [`0_UPDATE_RECIPE_TEMPLATE.sh`](https://github.com/Automattic/newspack-custom-content-migrator/tree/master/cli_scripts/update_recipes) always contains the most recent version of the Update Recipe.

Each Publisher gets their own custom Update Recipe file in this folder -- create a copy of the `0_UPDATE_RECIPE_TEMPLATE.sh` into this same directory, and name it by the Publisher, e.g. `update_publishername.sh`.

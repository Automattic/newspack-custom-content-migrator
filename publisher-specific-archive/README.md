# Archive for publisher specific code
This directory holds "older" code that has already been run on publishers.

If you need to use the code from a class again, simply move the file you want to the `src/Command/PublisherSpecific` directory.
You should be aware that code in this directory is unmaintained. That means that if there are refactorings done in our codebase, these files will not be kept up to date with those.
